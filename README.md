# Snake - Classic Arcade Game

Welcome to the **Snake Game**, a web-based recreation of the iconic arcade game. Players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, with the challenge of avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. This project is part of the larger **Arcade Classics** series, where we bring beloved retro games to modern web browsers.

This project is being developed by the **Software Division of the AAAIMX Student Chapter** for **educational purposes**. It is designed to offer an interactive and collaborative learning experience, where participants can explore web development and game design through hands-on practice.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Control the snake and grow as you collect food.
- **Simple, Clean Interface**: Styled with CSS for a minimalist, nostalgic look.
- **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
